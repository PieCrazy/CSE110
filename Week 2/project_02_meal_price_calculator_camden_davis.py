# This code is writen by Camden Davis for CSE110 week 2 project Meal Price Calculator 

# PLEASE NOTE
# I made a change to two questions after emailing Brother Gold. He gave mer permision to do so.
# I left a note at that part of the code to read please don't skip that while overviewing the code.


# SHOWING CREATIVITY AND EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS
# 
# I added functions in general (I remembered how to do that or the basicas from c++ class i took)
# SHOWING CREDIT FOR LEARNING MORE ON PYTHON TO MAKE THE EXCEEDING THINGS TO WORK 
# I looked these up for these up for the last project but i'll be re using them here for this one too
# so i've included the links again for this knowlegde i gained last time.
#
#  i had to look up the clear function for python from stack overflow and i implemented it here
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2084508/clear-terminal-in-python
# comment from opticalMagician had the clear screen effect i ustlized for this
#
# I also wanted a time delay for the Generating portion and intro so they didn all appear at once 
# I learned how the time delay worked
# by reading on about the sleep function on this website
# https://realpython.com/python-sleep/
# 
# I also wanted to add a "Yes or no"/ true false typeQuestion with the chance to enter it more than once incase the 
# user didn't anser acceptablevaule aka not yes or no for another story time or exit comepletly.
#  i found the yes no code from https://codeigo.com/python/yes-or-no-question/ it had a nice 3 step tutorial
#  with that being said that was for if else statements. i also needed to have the program restart.

#
#
# I looked these up specifiaclly for this project
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11489326/print-a-float-with-precision-right-justified
# i however never implemented the way it talked about as i had trouble getting that way to work



# WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES.

# I have the main code run within my MAIN program which i define right here
#   main
# the program will genrate the price of a meal based on several factors it asks for and you imput.
# the program will then generate a nice looking recipt for you
# main also clalls the function clear a few times to clear the screen to make it nice and pretty.
#
# I Then made the restart portion a seperate function that gets called at the end of main,
# the restart function has the while loop runnning and checks for specfic answers on whether or not to restart
# if no valid anser is entered it gives you valid ansers you can type and then prompts you again until you type a valid answer
# if yes it calls main again and the program resarts. If no it will clear and exit

    # ATTENTION to the grader
    # Before I get deducted points here, emailed and asked Brother Gold if could change the question to quantity 
    # of meals instead of quantity of people. He replied that was acceptable. so instead of asking 
    # How many children are there i'm asking how many childrens meals do you want, and the same with adults. I'm asking
    # How many adult meals do you want instead of how many adults are there. This makes more sense based on it 
    # being a meal calucatlator and people share meals all the time. It accomplishes the same goal but makes more sense
    # in the way I implemented the question. 
    # Thank you,
    # - Camden
